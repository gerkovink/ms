## generative AI

- Generative AI technologies are often developed by publicly traded companies with:
    - Deep pockets
    - Shareholders
    - Motives and goals that may diverge from academic or public interests

- These technologies also require significant computing resources for training and operation
  - This skews access and development to those with substantial resources.

- The energy consumption required for training large models contributes to carbon emissions. 
  - There is already a larger than necessary hidden carbon footprint

## AI in assessment
There is a finite number of options:

1. Ignore
2. Forbid
3. Circumnavigate
4. Test around
5. Embrace
6. Rethink


## AI in assessment
It is crucial to think about proper assessment designs for an AI-enabled student body. 

Here are some links that I find useful:

# Student & Staff survey

## Some general results
- 1633 Students
- 348 Teaching staff
- BA/MA balanced; few pre-master
- 34.4% of teaching staff report not to use GenAl for educational purposes vs. only 13.4% of students
- 68% of students use genAl for working with texts vs. 47% of staff
- Many students tend to use genAI to summarize texts or publications.

## Some interesting results
- Students see staff as `uninformed`, while staff sees students as `uninformed`.
- There is a huge cry for literacy training in GenAl from both students and staff. 
- 7.1% of teaching staff report that they use it for grading/assessment of work (no significant differences between faculties detected)


# Policy suggestion

## Current
- [UU policy](https://intranet.uu.nl/generatieve-ai-in-het-onderwijs/generatieve-ai-faq)
- [UMCU: Guidelines for GSLS students](https://students.uu.nl/en/gsls/practical-information/generative-ai-guidelines)
- [UMCU: GenAI guidelines for research projects for students and supervisors](https://students.uu.nl/sites/default/files/GSLS%20GenAI%20Research%20Guidelines%20for%20Students%20and%20SupervisorsGSLS%20GenAI%20Research%20Guidelines.pdf)

## Towards responsible genAI use
I believe that we should demand from the UU community to follow these simple steps when using generative AI tools:

1. Minimize the use of AI tools, as they are (currently) environmentally unfriendly
2. Don't input confidential or personal information
3. Don't input information that violates IP or copyright
4. Don't violate IP with using output from the tool
5. Confirm the output accuracy
6. Check the tool output for bias
7. Disclose the use of AI tools in your work
8. Don't do naughty or unjust things with AI tools
9. Ask the tool not to use input for training
10. Open the content you produce by using AI tools as much as possible with permissive licenses

If in doubt about any of the above, don't use generative AI tools.

For teachers: Put a disclaimer on your materials that governs what is or is not allowed when using generative AI tools.

## Final thoughts
- join the consortium
- talk to each other
- talk to me
